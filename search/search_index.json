Edit Global Scale Edit the scale at which Ragdoll draws things, like constraints. Ragdoll View your version, and eventually look for updates and tutorials. Not yet though. Create The top part of the menu contain commands to create new rigids. Active Rigid The rigid body, this outputs the translate and rotate channels that typically plug into your animation control. It lives as a shape, underneath your control, and is accessible via the Channel Box. Rigids either output or input a transform. The active rigid outputs a transform, passing information from solver into your Maya scene. Basics Basics Turn any native Maya polygon or NURBS object into a rigid by selecting it and clicking 'Active Rigid'. Multiple Selection Multiple Selection When two or more objects are selected - whether it be polygons, NURBS or joints - they'll all be turned into rigids. Blend Existing Animation Blend Existing Animation If the selected node(s) are animated, the animation can be used as a target for the subsequent simulation using the 'Blend' option. Blend and Edit Blend and Edit Once turned into rigids, your original animation remains intact and can be edited just like before. You can also blend between the original input and final simulation via the blendSimulation node. Passive Rigid Customise the creation of a new passive rigid body. Basics Basics Turn any polygonal, NURBS surface or joint into a rigid which can be animated but isn't affected by the simulation. Muscle Make a muscle from the selected anchor points. Option Description Default Aim Axis Which axis to treat as aim for the resulting muscle. X Up Axis Which axis to treat as the up-axis for the resulting muscle. Y Flex How much to allow the muscle to contract, from not-at-all to all-the-way. 0.75 Radius Capsule radius, how thick of a muscle to make. 1.0 Convert Rigid Convert selected Rigid to a different type. Option Description Default Rigid Type Convert a rigid from dynamic to kinematic, or vice versa. 'Auto' turns dynamic into kinematic and vice versa. Auto Convert Constraint Convert selected Constraint to a different type. Option Description Default Convert Constraint Type The type of constraint to convert to. Point Constraint Like normal Maya constraints, these limit the motion of one rigid relative another. For example, the Parent Constraint will make one rigid move as though it was a child of the other, whereas the Point Constraint will only limit position whilst letting orientation roam free. Option Description Default Constraint Type The type of constraint created. Point Maintain Offset Keep rigids where they are, or snap them together. Offsets can be manipulated with the Edit Constraint Frames menu item. True Auto Orient Orient constraint automatically by aiming towards the immediate child. Otherwise use the local orientation of the node. True Guide Strength Include some guide strength with this constraint. 1.0 Point Constraint the position of two rigid bodies. Orient Constrain the orientation of two rigid bodies. This doesn't have a physical equivalent, as you can't have something rotate the same as another object without also having some sort of positional relationship. Parent Constrain both the position and orientation of two rigid bodies. Useful for when you need multiple shapes for a single rigid. Socket Constraint the position and limit the orientation between two rigid bodies. Useful for things like shoulder and hip joints. Hinge A special kind of Socket Constraint where the X-axis (a.k.a. 'twist') is rotated 90 degrees. This constraint is especially well suited for hinge-like appendages, like elbows and knees. Utilities High-level tools for animators and riggers that build upon the lower-level concepts above. Everything here can be created manually using a combination of the above commends or by making the connections yourself. Character An auto-rigger, designed to produce an animatable character from a skeleton hierarchy. Option Description Default Copy Turn a copy of the selected hierarchy into a character, rather than the hierarchy itself. True Control Create an additional control hierarchy from generated character. True Normalise Shapes Make sure shapes are relatively evenly sized. This can help prevent 'stick-figures' which are tougher to control. False Stop Behaviour Whether to include the joint with a 'Stop' label in the generated character or not. Inclusive Dynamic Control Turn your regular character animation control into a rigid body, where the input animation is used as a dynamic guide for the simulation. The animation remains editable and the final result can be switched or blended between. Option Description Default Shape Type The initial shape to represent the selected control. Don't worry, this can be changed afterwards. - Mesh : Suitable for controls that wrap around the model - Capsule : Suitable for flat controls, e.g. a circle Mesh Last For Length Do not turn the last selected node into a dynamic control, use it to determine capsule length of the previous control. False Edit Global Scale Edit the scale of manipulators and visual elements of Ragdoll, especially constriants. If you work at a scale other than Maya's currently set units, this command is your friend. Option Description Default Gizmo Scale Scale at which to draw viewport widgets, like constraints. 1.0 Node Types All roads lead to Rome. In the case of Ragdoll, all nodes plug into rdScene which is where simulation takes place. Anything connected to it is able to interact with each other, it is typically where all rigids, constraints and forces related to a given character connects. Each Ragdoll node starts with rd , e.g. rdRigid Scene Container of all rigids, constraints and forces that interact. The scene represents the knowledge each simulation has, including rigids and their properties, constraints, forces. The works. There can be more than one Ragdoll scene in your Maya scene, but much like Maya scenes they cannot interact. The order in which scenes are simulated is also undefined, so you cannot expect e.g. fingers in one solver to run after the body in another solver. Rigid A single transform in or out of Ragdoll. The rigid is the physical equivalent of native Maya geometry. It can either feed into the simulation (passive) or come out of the simulation (active). Passive Rigid pass data from Maya to Ragdoll Active Rigid pass data from Ragdoll to Maya Constraint A relationship between two rigids. Typically this relationship is something to limit one or more axes - e.g. translateXYZ and rotateZ - of one rigid relative another rigid, like a door \"constrained\" to a wall. In that case, the wall would be considered a \"parent\" and the door a \"child\". However it is important to keep in mind that in the real world, there is no such thing. The door is as constrained to the wall as the wall is constrained to the door. This is especially apparent when the two constrained rigids are both active and have a similar mass, such as your upper and lower leg. As you bend your knee, both the thigh and lower leg are affected equally.","title":"Reference"},{"location":"reference/#menu","text":"All items found in the Ragdoll menu at the top of Maya's main window.

NEW Multi-threading Ragdoll now supports multiple solvers in the same Maya scene, each of which run in parallel offering a 2-3x increase in FPS NEW UI Menu items now have additional customisation with a new UI interface. NEW Animation Influence Dynamic Controls can now respond to animation input, either kinematically or as a guided influence to your simulation. This means you can turn your controllers dynamic, and add additional animation to steer the simulation! NEW Exploratory Menu The menu is now fully unlocked, with user-friendly messages letting you know how to use it if you are unfamiliar. The goal is facilitating exploration and curiosity in a safe environment with reliable undo. FIXED Hinge Constraint A constraint being converted to/from a hinge constraint no longer breaks the constraint. FIXED Set Initial State Modify the position and orientation of your rigid bodies after creation with this feature. Multi-Threading Ragdoll is now multi-threaded! There are two mechanisms for managing performance. Scene-level parallelism Solver-level parallelism With 2 or more Ragdoll solvers in the same Maya scene, Maya will run these in parallel. Which means they will both run independently, on separate hardware cores on your CPU. Currently, you can expect a 2-3x performance increase through use of multiple solvers, with more optimisation to come. A single Ragdoll solver can be automatically broken up into simulation \"islands\" that run in parallel. Islands are created when two or more groups of rigid bodies are unlikely or unable to interact. For example, two characters in the same solver far away from each other. To leverage solver-level parallelism, adjust the rdScene.threadCount attribute (under Advanced in the Attribute Editor). A value of 0 (default) means it will run on a single thread, on the same thread as the rest of Ragdoll and Maya. For small scenes, with less than 100 rigid bodies, you should expect improved performance from a single thread. Each thread comes with some amount of overhead. Option Dialogs Some menu items now have option dialog boxes for further customisation. Settings are stored with Maya's preferences and persists across scenes and between application launches.

Scene-level parallelism Solver-level parallelism With 2 or more Ragdoll solvers in the same Maya scene, Maya will run these in parallel. Which means they will both run independently, on separate hardware cores on your CPU. Currently, you can expect a 2-3x performance increase through use of multiple solvers, with more optimisation to come. A single Ragdoll solver can be automatically broken up into simulation \"islands\" that run in parallel. Islands are created when two or more groups of rigid bodies are unlikely or unable to interact. For example, two characters in the same solver far away from each other. To leverage solver-level parallelism, adjust the rdScene.threadCount attribute (under Advanced in the Attribute Editor). A value of 0 (default) means it will run on a single thread, on the same thread as the rest of Ragdoll and Maya. For small scenes, with less than 100 rigid bodies, you should expect improved performance from a single thread.

What is Rigid Body Dynamics? Loose thoughts that will eventually transform into a quick 10 second video. Rigid Body Dynamics is a branch of computer science which \"studies the movement of systems of interconnected bodies under the action of external forces\" . It differs from your typical simulation - such as nHair and nCloth - in that it simulates the translate and rotate channels of a given transform node rather than points of the geometry. The main advantage is that it is well suited for animation and rigging, since animation and rigging is all about translate and rotate. Ragdoll Jargon Rigid a.k.a. Dynamic Rigid Body is a transform affected by forces. Forces like Wind, but also contacts and constraints which are both considered forces, in that they happen instantaneously rather than continuously. Collider a.k.a. Kinematic Rigid Body is a transform affected by animation . It does not respect forces, but enables you to animate Shape Every rigid body has a shape, either Box , Sphere , Capsule or Mesh . Shape attributes are prefixed Shape * e.g. Shape Length affects the length of the Capsule , whereas Shape Extents affects the dimensions of the Box Constraint two rigids interact by either colliding and/or being constrained. Constraints work similarly to Maya Constraints, in that there is a parent and a child that lock either translate or rotate or both channels to each other.

ADDED Center of mass (Advanced) Now you can change the point at which a rigid body is balanced ADDED Angular mass (Advanced) Typically computed automatically from the shape and size of your rigid, now you can manually define this. ADDED Auto Connect More clarity, and also usable with things other than joints Dynamic Control 2.0 Ragdoll is currently very technical. It is exposing features of an underlying mathematical framework for solving \"Rigid-Body Dynamics\" ( wiki ) and tries to be as friendly about it as possible, but there is always a tradeoff in usability and flexibility. Dynamic Control was made to bridge that gap. It combines a user-selection with a series of commands to automatically try and figure out your intentions when those intentions are \"add some dynamics to my animation control\". Dynamic Control has been with Ragdoll for a few weeks now, and have undergone a series of changes to try and increase its intuitiveness whilst reducing complexity. It's hard! But in this release I'd like to present what I'm dubbing the \"2.0\" of Dynamic Control. The main differences are: Preserves existing animation rather than replacing it Simulation follows animation with additional \"stiffness\" and \"damping\" attributes stiffness is the \"springiness\" whereas damping is the \"plasticity\". A control can have 0 damping and be very springy and active. It can also have 0 stiffness, but that would basically disable it. On a technical note, the attributes exposed on your animation control are \"proxy\" attributes. Which means they can be animated either from your control, or from the source node, such as the rSocketConstraint shape node under your control. Here are some more videos to get you familiar with the tool. More videos Limitations Some limitations in this current version, yell if these affect you. Negative scale not allowed , the tool will refuse your request Rotate and scale pivots are zeroed out The same goes for all things Ragdoll at the moment. Center of Mass If you try and balance something on your finger, but the \"center of mass\" is off center, it would fall over. It is the point at which the weight of an object is equal in all directions. Ragdoll automatically computes this point based on what the shape looks like. For meshes, it will voxelise your geometry to figure out the physically accurate volumetric center of mass, assuming the density of the object is uniform throughout (rather than hollow or variadic, like swiss cheese). You can now override this point using rdRigid.centerOfMass . Guidelines For realistic results, leave it at 0 to compute the point automatically based on the shape For full control, override it Angular Mass In real life, if you spin a broom 180 degrees along its length; that's easy. But if you spin it 180 degrees along any other axis, like a ninja, it's considerably heavier. The reason is something called \"angular mass\" or \"moment of inertia\". It's like mass, but in terms of rotation rather than position. The broom has a low angular mass around its length axis, and a high angular mass in the other two axes. That makes it \"heavier\" around some axes but not others. This effect happens in Ragdoll too and is typically automatically computed for you based on the shape you use. If it looks like the broom, then the angular mass will also be lighter around its length then its width. With this release, you can now customise this for greater control of your rotations. When would you want to do that? Your shape looks like a broom, but you want it to act like a box Your shape doesn't look like a broom, but you would like it to Or any combination in between. :) Generally, a broom or any thin shape is more easily spun along its length, so you may find stability in setting your angular mass to (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) , at the expense of realism.

Active Rigid A rigid that moves is active Passive Rigid A rigid that doesn't move is passive This also goes for the kinematic attribute which has been renamed passive , highlighting that an active rigid can made passive by flicking this switch. Backwards compatibility is preserved by keeping the underlying attribute name, and only changing it in the Channel Box and Attribute Editor (i.e. the \"nice name\"). Character 2.0 - \"Auto-Ragger\" This release expands on the \"Character\" tool with some nifty new features. But since I haven't mentioned what 1.0 was capable of, here's an overall round down of what it is and when to use it. Character is a one-click character creation tool - and auto-rigger (or auto-ragger, if you will). It's designed to give you the essential tools for turning any native Maya skeleton into an animatable rigid body hierarchy. Read more about it on this new dedicated page I've made for it. Character Page Dynamic Control Capsules Now Dynamic Control can be configured to generate capsules between selected controls, instead of assuming that the NURBS CVs neatly wrap around the model. Current and Default behaviour The tool uses the Mesh shape per default like before. Alternative Capsules But if your controls do not have volume, or do not nicely wrap the underlying model, you can now use Capsules instead. The caveat with capsules is that the tool cannot know how long to make your capsules. Therefore, there is an option to use the last-selected node as a hint for how long to make it. In this example, 5 nodes selected, 1 passive and 3 active rigids comes out. If you don't use a last selection for length, the last selected capsule will have a length of 0 (it'll be a sphere). That can work in some cases, but is generally discouraged. The center of mass would be wrong and you should expect unrealistic results until you tweak it to fit your model. Gathering information about Dynamic Control on the.. Dynamic Control Page Normalise Shapes An early version of the \"Normalise Sizes\" tool, meant to more evenly distribute sizes of shapes across a hierarchy. Per default, shapes are sized based on the geometry of the Maya node. If it's a box, it'll get the dimensions of the box. If it's a joint, it'll get the length and radius of that joint. But because this mechanism can't see past the one node it's looking at, it's an uphill battle making shapes evenly distributed in a greater network. The \"Normalise Sizes\" tool is meant to address that. It's still early, and a few things are missing. Resolve Self-intersections These are more likely to happen the larger shapes get. Handle spine It tends to become too thin and desperately needs to be thickened up Time Multiplier Now you can speed up or slow down your simulation with a multiplier attribute found on the rdScene node! If you need something happening really-really fast , don't forget to also up your Substeps . If you need something even faster, like a bullet moving across the room in 2 frames, activate Continuous Collision Detection to prevent it from flying through stuff without noticing. For anything slower than real-time, remember contacts and constraints are solved each frame, so more frames means more accurate simulation. If you don't like that, you can either (1) half the substeps alongside halving time or (2) bake out the simulation and scale the bake instead. Example Scene Rotate Order Now rigids plya well with non-standard rotation orders, very common your everyday character animation rigs to ensure axes don't go gimbal. Thanks to Peter Jemstedt for help on this one! Auto Orient Shapes and constraints can now be automatically oriented based on the parent and child of each joint (soon coming to controls). This should help sort out those pesky joint orientations any manner of skeletons. Undo Bug There was this nasty bug that caused rdRigid nodes to remain behind after creating and then undoing. But what got left behind wasn't your normal nodes. They only appeared in the Node Editor and could not be selected or even deleted. They would show themselves out when re-opening the Maya scene which is great. This visibility isn't a problem in itself, if it wasn't for them also being visible from Python. If any command needed to know \"hey, animation control, are you connected to a rigid?\" then it would happily reply \"yes! for sure!\". And that's bad. But not anymore, because it's fixed! Stick Figures In a previous release I touched on \"angular mass\" and what it meant for your simulations. Let's look at this in practice. Here's one character with identical settings, the only difference is the radius of her capsules, and yet the move differently. Why is that? Remember that angular mass is 3-dimensional. Just like normal mass, when mass is high, more force is required to introduce motion. In the case of angular mass, the force required is divided into three axes. In this illustration, the angular mass along the X axis is much larger than Y and Z, so in to rotate around this axis you need much more force than the other two axes. There is however only 1 value for \"guide strength\". You can think of this force as being distributed across each axis, relative its mass. For example, if your Guide Strength is 10.0, then the distribution might look something like this. X Strength = 10 Y Strength = 2 Z Strength = 1 Whereas if angularMassX was equal like a square cube.. X Strength = 10 Y Strength = 10 Z Strength = 10 In light of this, what are your options? Fit your geometry The most realistic behaviour is what you get when model your shapes to the geometry you are animating. Adjust to taste If there is no geometry, or if the geometry is of an actual stick figure that you would like to act like a person, thicknen up your shapes. To separate between behaviour and collisions, add a second rigid and disable collisions on the first. Edit angularMass The least intrusive but perhaps most complex option is to manually specify a preferred angular mass. Here's the scene and one more gif to keep you warm at night. https://files.ragdolldynamics.com/share/rKN1sryQ Some things to experiment with: What if she has a really heavy head? ..really heavy hand ? What if the Guide Strength was halved? ..or 10x?! What if you remove Guide Strength on her hip? What if you add an extra Guide to her head? Animation in 1995 Stumbled upon this (thanks Jarl!) which I think is a great example of what I think we're ready to move away from as an industry. :) https://twitter.com/jeandenishaas/status/1330671654477860864 Here's a prediction for you - about a year from now, you won't be keyframing anymore.

If you need something happening really-really fast , don't forget to also up your Substeps . If you need something even faster, like a bullet moving across the room in 2 frames, activate Continuous Collision Detection to prevent it from flying through stuff without noticing. For anything slower than real-time, remember contacts and constraints are solved each frame, so more frames means more accurate simulation. If you don't like that, you can either (1) half the substeps alongside halving time or (2) bake out the simulation and scale the bake instead.

But what got left behind wasn't your normal nodes. They only appeared in the Node Editor and could not be selected or even deleted. They would show themselves out when re-opening the Maya scene which is great. This visibility isn't a problem in itself, if it wasn't for them also being visible from Python. If any command needed to know \"hey, animation control, are you connected to a rigid?\" then it would happily reply \"yes! for sure!\". And that's bad. But not anymore, because it's fixed!","title":"Undo Bug"},{"location":"releases/2020.12.01/#stick-figures","text":"In a previous release I touched on \"angular mass\" and what it meant for your simulations. Let's look at this in practice. Here's one character with identical settings, the only difference is the radius of her capsules, and yet the move differently. Why is that? Remember that angular mass is 3-dimensional. Just like normal mass, when mass is high, more force is required to introduce motion. In the case of angular mass, the force required is divided into three axes. In this illustration, the angular mass along the X axis is much larger than Y and Z, so in to rotate around this axis you need much more force than the other two axes. There is however only 1 value for \"guide strength\". You can think of this force as being distributed across each axis, relative its mass. For example, if your Guide Strength is 10.0, then the distribution might look something like this. X Strength = 10 Y Strength = 2 Z Strength = 1 Whereas if angularMassX was equal like a square cube.. X Strength = 10 Y Strength = 10 Z Strength = 10 In light of this, what are your options? Fit your geometry The most realistic behaviour is what you get when model your shapes to the geometry you are animating. Adjust to taste If there is no geometry, or if the geometry is of an actual stick figure that you would like to act like a person, thicknen up your shapes. To separate between behaviour and collisions, add a second rigid and disable collisions on the first. Edit angularMass The least intrusive but perhaps most complex option is to manually specify a preferred angular mass. Here's the scene and one more gif to keep you warm at night. https://files.ragdolldynamics.com/share/rKN1sryQ Some things to experiment with: What if she has a really heavy head? ..really heavy hand ? What if the Guide Strength was halved? ..or 10x?! What if you remove Guide Strength on her hip? What if you add an extra Guide to her head?","title":"Stick Figures"},{"location":"releases/2020.12.01/#animation-in-1995","text":"Stumbled upon this (thanks Jarl!) which I think is a great example of what I think we're ready to move away from as an industry. :) https://twitter.com/jeandenishaas/status/1330671654477860864 Here's a prediction for you - about a year from now, you won't be keyframing anymore.

FIXED Dynamic Control and Undo If your controls have pre-existing animation, undo will now work properly FIXED Dynamic Control and Auto Orient If you controls have intermediate groups between themselves, auto axis will now work properly Blend Rigid Non-destructive guidance from your original animation when making active rigid bodies. This works much like Dynamic Control , except the guidance is in worldspace. :) Look at this example of driving an IK handle with physics. You can blend between simulation and animation using the blendSimulation node in the Channel Box. Dynamic Control Capsules Change shape type, after creation. No matter the starting type. In the previous release, I added an option for generating dynamic controls as capsules instead of using the actual NURBS geometry. The usecase is for controls that don't have enough geometry to sufficiently wrap around the underlying geometry. This release enables the user to switch between capsules and mesh after having made the dynamic control. Previously, it was only possible to switch from Capsule to Mesh, not the other way around. Dynamic Control and Undo You couldn't undo, now you can. I found and patched a nasty bug that affected any Dynamic Control - and in fact any Rigid - created with anyhting that had pre-existing animation or connections of any kind, breaking undo. Dynamic Control and Orient Orientations were whack, now they're back. Previously, the orientation of dynamic controls were determined by the physical hierarchy of the control. If the immediate parent was the expected parent control, all was well. But in real-world rigs, there are typically several intermediate groups - some empty, some constrained, some offsets. In such cases, the immediate parent can't be assumed to be the visible parent control the animator sees on screen. This releases solves this by treating the user-selection as the hierarchy, regardless of what the actual hierarchy looks like.
