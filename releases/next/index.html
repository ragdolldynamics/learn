<p>Something <strong>amazing</strong> has happened.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134300628-565e7da1-c669-47ef-9fe2-f3b2023de875.png" /></p>
<p>Since release only a few weeks ago, Ragdoll is now used in production across the globe in over a dozen countries at the most major of studios, several dozens of mid-sized studios wanting to gain an advantage and hundreds of independent animators and riggers alike.</p>
<p>And that is amazing, it is. But something even more amazing has happened; Ragdoll has <strong>leaped forward</strong>. And that will be what the next 4-part release is about.</p>
<p>See, since launch I've had conversations with animators using Ragdoll for the very first time. One of those animators made a request that at first glance didn't look like much.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>"I don't like working with green channels, as it is not ideal for animating. Is there a way to I can overcome this?" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/3dsketchbook/">Christopher Page</a></p>
</div>
<p>Here's what he was referring to.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134045504-28e64cbb-cf4a-4d7c-8761-e8b05275d3ee.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>Notice how the nodes with physics applied got green channels? The reason they are green is because Ragdoll is driving them. They are green rather than yellow because you can still edit them, at the same time as Ragdoll is editing them. Your changes will be reflected in the simulation, this is how you <em>control</em> the simulation as it is running.</p>
<p>Can we get rid of that connection? Well.. No? This is Ragdoll's connection to your controls. Without those.. there <em>is</em> no physics.</p>
<p>I quickly dismissed the idea and carried on with my day.. But then something <em>clicked</em>.. What if..?</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134046287-5b84322b-3da7-49d6-987e-67a463b33c56.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>In the next section, I'll dive into how this works and why this change goes far beyond just getting rid of green channels.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits at a glance</strong></p>
<ul>

<details class="info"><summary>I'm a techy, gimme the deets</summary><p>The reason this works is because Ragdoll will consider the <code>.worldMatrix</code> attribute of any control and this is the same attribute Maya itself uses for just about anything.</p>

<h3 id="animation-capture">Animation Capture</h3>
<p>Inspired by Motion Capture - Animation Capture is a new way to think about and work with physics in Maya. To learn about it, let's first understand how Motion Capture generally works.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134006344-53f2744f-cc7f-48b0-860d-d0313a353c1f.png" /></p>
<p>Here is a typical data pipeline for motion capture, from real-life actor to final character animation.</p>

<p>Each "marker" is a dud. Nothing of any complexity. Something for the camera(s) to recognise and track as it moves through space. Once tracked, it's able to translate this marker from a 2D image into a 3D position, and continues to do so for each marker, for the real processing to take place inside software.</p>
<p>Once the capture is complete, the human actor can remove the markers and go enjoy the rest of their day. The rest is up to the computer.</p>
<p>With 3D positions generated, software takes over to translate these points into a hierarchy; the FK joint hierarchy you may be familiar with if you've ever worked with mocap. The joint hierarchy can then be used to either drive the final geometry, or to drive a more complex character rig which in turn drives the final geometry.</p>
<p>Animation Capture is just like that, but in <strong>reverse</strong>. Instead of capturing a person, it captures your <em>character rig</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134128846-7c55bfe3-b2c6-418f-ab04-4e29f61a5ec2.png" /></p>

<p>Unlike motion capture, we'd like the result mapped back onto our character rig again, which is how animators iterate with physics.</p>

<h4 id="demo-1-basics">Demo 1 - Basics</h4>
<p>Ok, enough prelude, let's dive in.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<p>Here's what life was like before, with <code>Active Rigid</code>.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134164228-cb35df45-ad68-4217-bb5f-8fa389a232da.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>After</strong></p>
<p>And here's life with <code>Markers</code>.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134164221-d80135db-96b9-48ed-9ec0-1b8af73c8f86.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>Notice how the channels are left alone?</p>
<p>This is the key difference between <code>Marker</code> and <code>Rigid</code>. Although you still provide Ragdoll with controls, Ragdoll no longer <em>drives</em> your controls directly. Instead, it <em>shows</em> you what they would look like <em>if</em> they were driven with physics.</p>
<p>Once you're happy with what you see, you <code>Record</code>.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134164217-883c0635-6103-42da-87a1-0e9cd145aa1f.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4 id="demo-2-ragdoll">Demo 2 - Ragdoll</h4>
<p>Let's have a look at how <code>Markers</code> work with a full ragdoll.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setup hierarchy</strong></p>
<p>The first step is nothing new, you've seen it before.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134213480-bcf2f185-f0f1-4ab5-9f5c-9a72f108e7d3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>2. Edit shapes</strong></p>
<p>This too, it's second nature by now.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134213470-fa51e083-cfb9-494d-8f1b-2fb795a7ed9d.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Except!</p>
<p>Notice how the shapes overlap? That's ok! No longer will you have to worry about self-intersecting shapes. Unless you want it to, with the new <code>Self Collide</code> attribute. :D I'll touch on this a bit more below, under #self-collide</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Double Except!</p>
<p>Release 4/4 in this series will deal with the channel box, and make editing these values interactive in the viewport for a superior experience and a lot less clicks and fiddling with numbers.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Animate</strong></p>
<p>Now things are getting interesting. To keep our viewport clean, we can offset the simulation slightly. The offset is purely visual and won't affect the simulation or subsequent recording.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134213467-b0b9bae6-6778-409d-ad1a-4277e89961f9.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>4. Record</strong></p>
<p>Finally, and this is what separates <code>Markers</code> from <code>Rigids</code>, we record our simulation back onto our controls.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134213465-5739f9b5-a391-474d-b6ee-608a6e7c0194.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4 id="demo-3-inverse-kinematics">Demo 3 - Inverse Kinematics</h4>
<p>That last example was contrived. No rig is without IK, so how does <code>Markers</code> work here?</p>
<p><strong>1. No IK</strong></p>
<p>Since we put markers on the FK controls, Ragdoll doesn't know about what the IK controls are doing.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134312071-0eeb5ced-6bab-4793-9edd-6f5747ceb3ed.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>2. Reassign</strong></p>
<p>So let's put markers on the <em>joints</em> driven by both IK and FK, such that when you switch between the two, Ragdoll knows how to follow along. So let's <code>Reassign</code>.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134312058-20f64011-954c-4d7b-b201-3950655449c0.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>3. Retarget</strong></p>
<p>But recording still targets our original FK controls, and what we want is to record our IK controls. So we can <code>Retarget</code>.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134312048-5e9100d8-ce55-4fa1-b704-2201182733db.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>4. Record Translation</strong></p>
<p>Unlike FK, IK isn't just rotation, but translation too. So let's tell Ragdoll to record the translation from these markers too.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134312041-fdaaad31-5273-44f4-891c-d1a80739de20.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>And there you have it! This works with IK, SpineIK, Follicles, Geometry Constraints; <em>anything</em> you can throw at it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="demo-4-real-world-example">Demo 4 - Real World Example</h4>
<p>Here's a work-in-progress animation from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/3dsketchbook/">Christopher Page</a> (thanks for lending it to me!) Let's see how we can use Ragdoll to help improve upon it.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Problem</strong></p>
<p>Notice how the elbow intersects the table as he moves his torso around? A difficult problem and moving target as you need to keep tweaking both the torso and hand IK handle to tune your animation.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319921-6e96ef8c-1226-47b4-b3db-7f076047c62a.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>2. Isolate Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since this animation is over 600 frames, we'll isolate our work to a small portion of it. For both performance and cleanliness; Ragdoll will only record onto the current timeline (or selected portion of it).</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319912-57c3a8c6-3488-4129-9b1e-9567f77a0752.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>3. Assign Markers</strong></p>
<p>Like before, we'll assign markers to the underlying skeleton to respect what the IK solver does. We'll also make the hand <code>Kinematic</code> to respect the original animation exactly. The clavicle is also <code>Kinematic</code> per default, as it was the first assigned control - and is thus the "root" of our dynamic hierarchy.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319902-dc446cae-37c4-4c86-a746-2fd19364160c.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>4. Include Table</strong></p>
<p>Since we're interacting with the table, we'll include this too. Also <code>Kinematic</code>, no dynamics will be affecting it, and also as a <code>Box</code> shape to speed up and improve the stability of the simulation.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319896-0ddd0f5b-8e64-4f59-a93a-2fafc58b9994.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>5. Tune Shapes</strong></p>
<p>Next we'll isolate contacts with just the elbow area, to respect the hand and lower arm animation.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319889-6f7403cd-fec2-4fae-8b78-0efabf5afb04.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>6. Tune Material</strong></p>
<p>In this case, we'd like for the elbow to slide across the table, no friction.</p>
<details class="info"><summary>More Realism?</summary><p>In the real world, there would be friction and it could come in handy here too. But what should we expect from the elbow rubbing against the table? We should include the torso for this as well, which you absolutely can (and maybe should!). But to keep things simple, we'll let the clavicle preserve it's original animation exactly.</p>
</details>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319878-d57ce899-bd03-4eb3-b97f-2e4dd5761f74.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>7. Retargeting</strong></p>
<p>Ragdoll will record onto the nodes you originally assign, but like before we want recording to go elsewhere; from joints to IK controls.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319871-2c804a4d-26b1-4a8f-932c-722aeb98189f.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>8. Record Translation</strong></p>
<p>Likewise, we'd also like translation included. And we don't care for the shoulder and clavicle animation; all we want is the IK handle and Pole Vector.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319865-dc88b9a9-bb8d-48df-9ec0-f3f5fe760903.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>9. Record Simulation</strong></p>
<p>We're all set! Let's hit <code>Record</code>!</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319858-e82de1cc-4ed7-4dea-be07-8e59acc078af.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>10. Before And After</strong></p>
<p>And there we go! 2 minutes or less, and you've got a reusable setup for correcting the elbow whenever the animation changes. IK is intact and you can keep working with keyframes. Keeping Ragdoll attached to your rig has <em>zero</em> impact on performance (as you can see by looking at the fps counter near the bottom of the two comparisons), and once hidden it has no impact on your Outliner either. All clean!</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134319855-66c960d7-9d74-4bbf-bde4-5e813c7123cd.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>Here's one more I couldn't find room for, an earlier version of the animation with <em>stepped keys</em> and finger simulation. Look at all that juicy finger interaction with the table. 😊</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134513003-7b25c2d1-87e8-4853-a89d-a73b3a5ba2e2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4 id="recording">Recording</h4>
<p>Markers can be recorded all together, or independently. For example, say you wanted animation from frame 1-100, simulate 101-150 and return to animation from 151-200. You can do that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, say you liked what the simulation was doing, but only on one half of the body. Or only on the hip, driving the main trajectory in a physically-plausible way. Keeping the rest of your animation intact.</p>
<p><strong>Record All</strong></p>
<p>With nothing selected, Ragdoll will record all marked controls to the current Maya playback range.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134327104-f3d54cda-4d88-480a-b263-faceb211e87a.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>Record Selected Markers</strong></p>
<p>Select a few controls to control what gets recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Intelligent Range</strong></p>
<p>A <code>Kinematic</code> marker is entirely animated, so there's no need to actually record those. Ragdoll will ensure only non-kinematic frames are recorded, so you can do things like this.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134504192-3514f235-1f9c-4ce8-83e5-6704bf3036df.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4 id="input-type">Input Type</h4>
<p>In the above examples, I mentioned <code>Kinematic</code> and you probably spotted a few other options too, like <code>Inherit</code> and <code>Guide</code>. What are those?</p>
<p>The <code>Input Type</code> is how Ragdoll should interpret the controls you assign. Did you mean for them remain animated, i.e. <code>Kinematic</code>? Or should they follow the control around, i.e. <code>Guide</code>? Or should they just fall with gravity, ignoring the original control altogether, i.e. <code>Off</code>?</p>
<p>The <code>Input Type</code> can be set either for a whole group of markers, or each marker individually.</p>

<p><br></p>
<h4 id="retarget">Retarget</h4>
<p>We've talked a lot about "retargeting". But what <em>is</em> that?</p>
<p>Per default, markers are recorded onto the controls you assigned, this is called <code>Rig to Rig</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134169658-39590bbf-bbca-41dc-af3b-de20e69e9aed.png" /></p>
<p>But often times, rigs are more complicated and what you want is for the simulation to look at one set of nodes, but record onto another. This is called <code>Joint to Rig</code>, but can be from any source. Even other controls (like FK to IK).</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134169635-e0a751c8-f06b-4dac-a459-50118d04821f.png" /></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">The Old Days</p>
<p>Think about how you would accomplish this using the <code>Active Rigid</code> or <code>Active Chain</code> commands. That would be a <em>huge</em> pain, but not with markers!</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="reassign">Reassign</h4>
<p>Over in <a href="#demo-2---ragdoll">Demo 2 - Ragdoll</a> we "reassigned" already marked controls. What does that mean?</p>
<p>In that example, we've assigned our FK controls directly, which means Ragdoll would grab the translation and rotation from those controls during simulation. But what we really wanted was the IK controls.</p>
<p>But! We couldn't just assign to the IK controls directly, since they are <em>indirectly</em> rotating a characters limbs. So instead, we <code>Reassign</code> the markers previously made onto the underlying joints that follow IK around.</p>
<p>We then also <code>Retarget</code> them, since they would have otherwise been recorded onto the original FK controls.</p>

But unlike the <code>Rigid</code>, another significant advantage to <code>Markers</code> is their ability to capture both local <em>and worldspace</em> position and orientation of your controls. And because of this, you are able to interactively choose whether a marker should look at the <em>Worldspace</em> or <em>Localspace</em> position of your controls.</p>

<p>Notice how with a <code>Guide Space = -1</code> the controls arms remain relative the torso. And with <code>Guide Space = 1</code> they instead follow the <em>worldspace</em> orientation of the controls. Just like a Soft Pin.</p>
<p>This attribute is also <strong>animatable</strong>, and is how you can transition from animation into simulation and back again.</p>

<h3 id="transitions">Transitions</h3>
<p>Let's have a look at how you would use markers to transition between simulation and animation.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134507548-382a0ccd-85b6-4990-b325-16dbd3b7d568.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>Notice how we're animated up until the jump, and then Ragdoll takes over. Once he approaches that box, we turn our <code>Guide Space</code> from <code>-1</code> to <code>1</code> and have him reach the target pose in worldspace. Once he's close, we switch <code>Input Type</code> to <code>Kinematic</code> and kinematically move him until we once again transition to <code>Guide</code>, this time with a <code>Guide Space</code> or <code>-1</code> for pose space.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134507546-49e84d32-b50a-48c6-a1b9-82410281a884.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="self-collision">Self Collision</h3>
<p>Previously, it was very important that your shapes did not overlap any shape other than it's immediate neighbour. If they did, chaos ensued.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<p>Clavicles intersect their parent spine, but also each other!</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134362062-4197b3d6-2694-4011-9a8e-69adec92927f.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>After</strong></p>
<p>With the new <code>Self Collision = Off</code>, this is no longer a problem.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134362067-a2d33df3-c9d1-4aa8-b8af-956d80aeba7e.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>This can be taken into the extreme!</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134362070-325aa8dc-3367-4765-a4a9-56670cc77b83.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>And here's a another example to fill out a large volume in the center of a character.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134368633-ed4f69f4-1eba-4702-a3f6-bdddd2f0a98d.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Notice how the spine is made up of many shapes, some of which cover the width of the body, others the depth. An overlapping mess that would never have simply not have been possible without self-collision support!</p>

<h3 id="no-graph-editor-mess">No Graph Editor Mess</h3>
<p>Because <code>Rigids</code> were children of your controls, Maya had a funny way of including them in the Graph Editor that rightly drove animators, myself included, <em>absolutely mad</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<p>Just look at this; why-oh-why would I want channels from a completely unrelated node when working with the hip?</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134341270-72843d85-70c9-43af-86cc-c981e87fe297.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>After</strong></p>
<p>Contrast that to this, whereby only the nodes you actually select are made visible. You can even select <code>Markers</code> via the Channel Box and <em>deselect</em> your controls to get up real close.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134341497-cb64e666-75e6-4bfd-a3bd-aee27a61791b.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="no-initial-state">No Initial State</h3>
<p>A significant effort was made to make the simulation start where you expected it to.</p>
<p>Under the hood, simulation and animation were at odds with one another. Ragdoll needed to know where to start, but it was also telling your controls where to start. It's an inherent cycle, which was finally broken.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Read More</p>
<p>You can read all about the month-long journey in the <a href="/releases/2021.03.01/">release notes from March</a></p>
</div>
<p>Nowadays, you barely have to think about it, but it does occasionally rear its ugly head. It is a hack.</p>
<p>With <code>Markers</code> there isn't any cycle to begin with. Ragdoll only reads from your controls, it doesn't write to anything. Under the hood, recording is a 2-step process; first it simulates, and then it writes animation back onto the controls. That's how this cycle is broken, without having any effect on the overall workflow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="no-more-cycles">No More Cycles</h3>
<p>With the previous version, because <code>Rigids</code> both read and wrote to each control, you could sometimes run into a situation where the parent depends on a child.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<p>Here, I'll try and make a second chain in the opposite direction of how the controls are laid out hierarchically. This cannot work; because in order for Ragdoll to figure out where the Passive hand should be, it would first need to consult the upper arm, which is both dynamic and a child of the spine, which is also dynamic. It's a lovely cycle. ❤️</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134480453-279620c2-0a68-48fc-aad4-5c24c146265d.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><strong>After</strong></p>
<p>With <code>Markers</code>, this isn't a problem because to Ragdoll every limb can now be independently evaluated, in parallel.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134480451-f9be80ba-2579-485e-a4e4-ad92d0da4491.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<h3 id="lollipop-controls">Lollipop Controls</h3>
<p>Sometimes, markers are added to an already busy control with tons of Channel Box entries. Lollipop controls can help organise things a little better.</p>

<h3 id="quality-of-life">Quality of Life</h3>
<p>Some minor things to brighten your day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="real-ground">Real Ground</h4>
<p>With <code>Rigids</code>, the ground was embedded into the scene. With <code>Markers</code>, an actual ground is created to for more stability and more control over its physical parameters. Something that can also be animated, and that dynamically appears right underneath your markers.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134493174-f57cc5ce-5056-4cfa-b98e-fae9114342fc.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4 id="joints-and-the-attribute-editor">Joints and the Attribute Editor</h4>
<p>The Attribute Editor doesn't show you <code>Rigids</code> related to Maya joints because of a Maya UI quirk.</p>
<p>With <code>Markers</code>, this is no longer a problem!</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134464806-041e6abb-4be0-442f-b51d-d4a9776fd88b.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="hidden-solver">Hidden Solver</h4>
<p>Hiding the solver completely removes all overhead of having Ragdoll in your scene. Previously, with <code>rdScene</code> and <code>rdRigid</code>, because they were directly connected to your controls, hiding things made little difference. But now, because we no longer have this direct connection, all computations come from explicitly seeing the <code>rdSolver</code> node.</p>
<p>No visible <code>rdSolver</code> node, no computations. Period.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="enhanced-determinism">Enhanced Determinism</h4>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">TLDR</p>
<p>Sometimes, re-opening the scene could lead to different results. This has now been fixed.</p>
</div>
<p>Each time you play a simulation starting from the beginning, the results are the same. This is an important characteristic of any simulation and is called "determinism". It used to be the case however that when you re-opened the scene, there was a small chance the results would differ from when you last saved it.</p>
<p>This has now been fixed. The determinism is now dependent on the order in which rigid bodies connect to the <code>rdSolver</code> node. It's an array attribute, whose order is saved with the Maya scene.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="multiple-floating-licences">Multiple Floating Licences</h3>
<p>Whenever a machine connected to your floating licence server, the host and IP were stored on the machine in an effort to speed up subsequent connections made. However, this also meant that you weren't able to <em>update</em> those details.</p>
<p>Despite providing new details, Ragdoll would favour the already-stored details. Worse yet, the Ragdoll UI would <em>lie</em> to you, by repeating the connection details provided in the <code>RAGDOLL_FLOATING</code> environment variable, despite those not actually being used.</p>
<p>This release addresses this by always using the details you provide, and not bother reusing any previously provided details. In addition, you now have the option to explicitly query and set server details directly.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Will query the *actual* server used by Ragdoll, rather</span>
<span class="c1"># than return the environment variable you provided</span>

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="next-release">Next Release</h3>
<p>This release is part &frac14;, for next 2/4 release you can expect <em>Performance Improvements</em>.</p>
<p>In this release, simulation and overall Maya scenegraph performance has seen a 200x performance boost, the performance is already there. You'll notice it as you try them on your rigs.</p>
<p>However, <em>rendering</em> performance has dropped significantly, cancelling out <em>most</em> of that performance gain. Here's what performance looks like now.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134397400-44ed30ce-b5c2-4cf7-9a24-2783a685b082.png" /></p>
<p>Rendering mostly Maya default shading, rendeing its own things. Unrelated to Ragdoll. The Rig Evaluation on the other hand is almost entirely Ragdoll. It's connected to every control in this rig, forcing each control to be evaluated in serial; one after the other.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like with <code>Markers</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134399139-cbe27611-3445-4453-b901-fbe1687dd299.png" /></p>
<p>Notice the huge pile of lines to the left? Those are all running parallel and almost entirely default Maya evaluations; things your rig would do without Ragdoll. Rendering on the other hand is almost entirely Ragdoll, it is <em>very</em> slow.</p>
<p>To properly compare performance between <code>Rigids</code> and <code>Markers</code>, here's what you should be looking at.</p>
<p><video autoplay class="poster" muted loop width=100% controls><source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/134398643-bf2e3086-a8f6-4ea7-8e58-011c866acaaa.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>This is the only thing Ragdoll does to your rig. This is the entire overhead, the added load onto your rig. 16 <em>microseconds</em>. That's <code>0.016 ms</code>. For a rig to run at 30 fps, it'll need <code>1,000/30 = 33 ms</code> per frame. This overhead, <code>0.016 ms/frame</code> is all Ragdoll needs to solve an entire character, contacts and constraints and forces, all of it. In this particular profiling, that's 430x faster than <code>Rigids</code>, which not only took longer to solve but made everything else slower by just being connected to your controls.</p>
<p>So how about we get this rendering performance sorted, shall we?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>These are some of the things lacking from <code>Markers</code> in this release that we'll be working on for subsequent releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting rigids interacively</li>
<li>Manipulating shapes interactively</li>
<li>Manipulating constraints interactively</li>
<li>Toggle between previous animation and recorded simulation</li>
<li>Support for recording onto an animation layer</li>
<li>No "live-mode", where physics drives a control interactively</li>
<li>Markers cannot be exported</li>
<li>Markers cannot have additional constraints</li>
</ul>
